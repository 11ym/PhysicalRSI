# Auto-engineering lab demo

See the [integration TODO](TODO.md) for the planned skill condensation, memory
retrieval and controlled transfer experiments through the physicalRSI pipeline.

A self-built Isaac Sim scene: a Franka arm transfers a blue sample tube from a
source stand into a green receiving rack without disturbing an amber beaker
or a red distractor. The bench, racks, room and sample vials are authored for this demo. Optional
LabUtopia meshes supply the glass beaker and background drying oven, while a
Poly Haven HDRI supplies studio illumination. No RoboDojo scene, task registry
or expert trajectory is used. The Franka robot is an external NVIDIA asset.

The workflow follows the engineering loop described in
[General Robotics' Auto-Engineering article](https://www.generalrobotics.company/post/introducing-auto-engineering-for-robotics):

1. **Robot ingestion:** record joint names, sensor contracts, simulator and assets.
2. **World experience:** build a lab and generate reproducible randomized layouts.
3. **Skill creation:** compose RGB-D detection with physical pick/lift/carry/release.
4. **Evaluation and repair:** diagnose a development failure, propose a higher
   carrying path, compare both versions on new paired layouts, and retain only
   an improvement through the existing `SelfHarness` and `HarnessState`.

## Presentation assets

Download assets outside the source tree using a separate Python environment
with `usd-core` installed:

```bash
python scripts/prepare_lab_assets.py --assets-dir /path/to/lab-assets
export PHYSICALRSI_LAB_ASSETS=/path/to/lab-assets
```

The script checks the LabUtopia source digest and records the derived mesh and
HDRI hashes. LabUtopia assets are **CC BY-NC 4.0**; Poly Haven lighting is **CC0**.
See the generated `lab-assets.json` for source links and modifications. Assets
are downloaded separately and are not redistributed in this repository. The
lab uses authored fallback glassware if the optional assets are absent.

## Run

Use Python 3.11 with Isaac Sim 5.1 and its extension cache installed, following
[NVIDIA's instructions](https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/5.1.0/installation/install_python.html).
Install the simulator dependencies with
`/path/to/isaac-env/bin/python -m pip install -r PhysicalRSI_demos/auto_engineering/requirements-isaac.txt`.
Install the lightweight physicalRSI dependencies in the launcher environment.
Run from the repository root:

```bash
./physicalrsi auto-engineering \
  --workspace /path/to/fresh/lab-run \
  --isaac-python /path/to/isaac-env/bin/python \
  --episodes 3
```

The command executes one native development episode, then (if a repair is
proposed) three paired validation layouts for each policy. Outputs include:

- `index.html`: local video report, diagnosis, scores and selected revision.
- `round-001/development/`: RGB, depth, USD scene, video and native evidence.
- `round-001/episodes/`: parent/child validation recordings on identical layouts.
- `round-001/selection.json`: verified paired selection, when a comparison exists.
- `state/history/`: immutable lineage and source-bound evidence.

A tie retains the parent. A failed process aborts the round; it is not counted
as an ordinary policy failure. Existing workspaces are not silently rerun.
Inspect their evidence and use a new workspace for a new run. `--gui` requests
a visible Isaac window. To rebuild the report from completed evidence:

```bash
./physicalrsi auto-engineering --workspace /path/to/lab-run --report-only
```

For an individual native episode, write a memory JSON containing
`{"transit_height_m": 0.36, "sample_height_m": 0.12}` and run:

```bash
/path/to/isaac-env/bin/python -m PhysicalRSI_demos.auto_engineering.isaac_scene \
  --seed 17 --memory /path/to/memory.json --output /path/to/new-episode
```

## What the result means

This is a **simulation development demo**, not a reproduction of GRID's full
platform, physical deployment, or a benchmark-wide score. Its System 2 is one
explicit, bounded engineering rule authored by Codex: use a detected obstacle's
height and sample dimensions to propose a higher transit path. It does not
claim unrestricted autonomous code synthesis or model training.

System 1 receives color detections from RGB, rendered metric depth, camera
calibration and robot proprioception. Color labels intentionally make this
first demo inspectable. It does not use a learned general-purpose detector or
RGB-only depth estimation. Simulator object poses are restricted to evaluation and presentation recording;
they are never supplied to the policy. The
policy runs as reviewed in-process code; this boundary is not an OS sandbox
attestation.

The evaluator checks the correct sample's destination, upright orientation,
release, settling, and disturbance of the beaker and distractor. Beaker
translation is a limited obstacle-disturbance check, not exhaustive contact
certification. Detailed render meshes use declared cylindrical collision proxies. The beaker
has a glass render mesh; no liquid is simulated.
There are no teleportation actions or synthetic attachment joints.

Scene generation, policy, perception and evaluator code are frozen by source
hashes for a round. Native receipts retain layout identities and file digests.
The external Isaac/NVIDIA dependency and asset closure is not fully attested.
`qualification` remains `null` even if all declared simulation checks pass.

## Software checks

```bash
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/test_auto_engineering.py
```

These check sensor filtering, layout generation, evaluator failure cases and
bounded repair behavior. They do not prove that Isaac Sim initializes or that
a robot completes the task; only native receipts and recordings establish that.

## High-quality success video

A successful native episode records rigid-body poses alongside its joint trace.
Render those measured states with the Isaac environment:

```bash
OMNI_KIT_ACCEPT_EULA=YES /path/to/isaac-env/bin/python \
  -m PhysicalRSI_demos.auto_engineering.high_quality \
  --episode /path/to/successful/episode --output /path/to/new-render \
  --width 3840 --height 2160 --samples 512
```

This uses path tracing, 16 ray bounces, denoising and a high-quality H.264 export.
`--frame 300` renders one recorded frame for a quality/time check; add `--count 3`
to measure consecutive-frame throughput. Lossless PNG frames are retained beside
the video. After interruption, repeat the identical command with `--resume` to
verify and reuse completed frames. A complete NVIDIA driver installation, including the OptiX denoiser
weights, is required for denoising. On a headless container with an unusable
GLX Vulkan ICD, set `VK_ICD_FILENAMES` to the EGL ICD written by the native
harness in its runtime directory (or an equivalent system EGL ICD). The source
receipt and trajectory digests bind the render to the native episode. Recorded body positions and rotations are checked after every captured frame. Physics
is disabled during presentation replay: this is a re-render of measured states,
not a second evaluation or additional success evidence. The original native
video and receipts remain available for comparison.
